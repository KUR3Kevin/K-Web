### Key Strategies for Success

#### Build an Emergency Fund First
Before investing heavily, save $5,000 in your savings account. This provides a safety net for unexpected expenses.

#### Pay Off High-Interest Debt
Credit cards charge 18% APR. Pay these off before low-interest debt to save money.

#### Live Below Your Means
Keep expenses lower than income. The difference can be saved or invested.

#### Diversify Investments
Don't put all your money in one stock. Spread risk across multiple investments.

#### Be Patient
Compound interest and investment returns work best over time. Don't expect instant results!

#### Take Advantage of Dividends
Stable Dividends Co. pays $0.50 per share monthly. This provides passive income!

## Financial Concepts Explained

### Net Income
**Formula:** Income - Expenses = Net Income

This is the money you have left after paying bills. Positive net income allows you to save and invest.

### Compound Interest (Savings)
**Formula:** A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (starting amount)
- r = Annual interest rate
- n = Number of times interest compounds per year
- t = Time in years

Your savings earn 2.5% APY compounded monthly, meaning you earn interest on your interest!

### Debt Interest
**How it works:** Debt balances accumulate interest monthly.
- Credit Card: 18% APR = 1.5% monthly
- Personal Loan: 8% APR = 0.67% monthly

If you owe $1,000 on a credit card, you'll be charged $15 in interest each month if you don't pay it off.

### Net Worth
**Formula:** Net Worth = Cash + Savings + Investment Value - Total Debt

This is the true measure of your financial health. Growing net worth is the ultimate goal!

### Stock Investing
- Stocks represent ownership in companies
- Prices fluctuate based on market conditions
- Higher volatility = higher risk but potentially higher returns
- Dividends are payments companies make to shareholders
